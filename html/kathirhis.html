    <b>ABOUT KATHIR</b>
    <P>Kathir is an Indian actor who appears in Tamil language films. He made his breakthrough by playing the lead role
        in Madha Yaanai Koottam (2013)[1][2] and gained critical acclaim for his performance in Kirumi (2015), Vikram
        Vedha (2017), Pariyerum Perumal (2018) and Sigai (2019).[3] In 2022, he starred in the Prime Video thriller
        series Suzhal: The Vortex.</P>

    <B>CAREER</B>
    <P>Kathir made his debut as an actor through Vikram Sukumaran's Madha Yaanai Koottam (2013), which was produced by
        noted music composer G. V. Prakash Kumar Kathir acted in this movie during his college studies. In the evenings,
        after finishing college studies, he went to shootings.[5] The film opened to positive reviews, with Kathir
        earning critical acclaim for his portrayal of a village youngster. A critic from The Hindu stated Kathir "tries
        to do his best", while Sify.com stated he had done "a good job in his first role".[6][7][8] Kathir then won
        critical acclaim for his performance in the thriller film, Kirumi (2015) directed by Anucharan and written by
        Manikandan.[9][10] The film was also sent to international film festivals, with a critic from The Hollywood
        Reporter noting that "playing his namesake character, Kathir makes for a particularly avid small-time crook,
        effortlessly cataloging useful information for the police officers he smoothly ingratiates himself with by dint
        of feigned respect and subtle manipulation".[11][12]

        In 2017, he was seen in the action thriller Ennodu Vilayadu alongside Bharath. He was also cast in Vikram Vedha
        with R. Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi, Pa. Ranjith's production Pariyerum Perumal (2018), for which he attained
        national acclaim and was noted for his "outstanding performance". In 2019, Sigai, where he portrayed a gentle
        and dedicated performance of an effeminate man.[13][14] He then released Sathru (2019), a crime thriller.[15] He
        then performed in Bigil (2019), a sports movie directed by Atlee Kumar as a football coach.[16] Looking fresh
        from his Bigil football overkill, Kathir takes lead in a film that mixes entertainment, sport and horror to a
        confused extent. His film Jada (2019) is made with hefty intentions, but does not live up-to the
        expectations.[17] His film Sarbath was released as a direct television premier which received positive reviews
        as a family entertainer.

        As well as starring in follow-up movies, he had starred in an Amazon Prime Video series created by
        Pushkar-Gayathri hence Suzhal: The Vortex. The series garnered a widespread pan-India response as well as
        favorable and positive reviews from the audience and critics alike.[18] The actor garnered a lot of attention
        for his acutely stylized acting skills as well as his choice of script selection as both a fresh and meticulous
        actor.</P>
