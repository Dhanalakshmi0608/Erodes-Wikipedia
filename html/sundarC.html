    <B>CAREER</B>
    <P>Sundar began his career as an assistant director to Manivannan and made his directorial debut with the film Murai
        Maman in 1995. Initially, he intended to cast a leading action hero Sarathkumar for the lead role, but due to
        the producer's inability to secure the actor, Jayaram was selected instead, capitalizing on his comedic prowess.
        The film was a success at the box office.[2] Sundar then continued to focus on comedy films, directing Ullathai
        Allitha (1996), Mettukudi (1996) and Unakkaga Ellam Unakkaga (1999), all starring Karthik. In 1997, he directed
        the high-profile Arunachalam, with Rajinikanth. The film won three Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, including Best
        Film.[3]

        Sundar started the new millennium by directing the thriller Unnai Kann Theduthey (2000) and the action film
        Rishi (2001). In 2003, he directed both Anbe Sivam and Winner. While Winner was commercially successful, Anbe
        Sivam, despite being critically acclaimed, underperformed at the box office but later became a cult classic.[4]
        He continued his directorial ventures with Chinna (2005) and Rendu (2006).[5] Subsequently, Sundar transitioned
        to acting, making his lead debut in the commercially successful Thalai Nagaram (2006).[6][7] He continued to
        secure lead roles in hits like Veerappu (2007), directed by Badri, and Sandai (2008) by Sakthi Chidambaram. He
        received the Kalaimamani award from the Government of Tamil Nadu in 2009.[8] He then made a directorial comeback
        with Nagaram Marupakkam in 2010.

        In 2012, Sundar directed the comedy film Kalakalappu, which was a commercial hit.[9] He followed it up with
        Theeya Velai Seiyyanum Kumaru (2013), Aranmanai (2014), Aranmanai 2 (2016) and Kalakalappu 2 (2018). In 2019, he
        starred in the well-received horror thriller Iruttu, directed by V. Z. Durai,[10] and also directed Vishal's
        action film Action.[11] His subsequent release as a director and actor, Aranmanai 3, was successful at the box
        office despite being critically panned.[12] He later starred in Thalai Nagaram 2.[13] In 2024, he directed and
        starred in Aranmanai 4.</P>
