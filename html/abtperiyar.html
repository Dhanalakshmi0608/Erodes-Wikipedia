    <b>ABOUT PERIYAR</b>
    <P>Erode Venkata Ramasamy (17 September 1879 â€“ 24 December 1973), also called Periyar, Thanthai Periyar or E. V. R.
        by his followers, was an Indian philosopher, politician, independence and social activist. He started the
        Self-respect Movement or the dravidian Movement and proposed the creation of an independent state called Dravida
        Nadu, uniting the states of South India. He was also the founder of the socio-cultural organization, Dravidar
        Kazhagam. Periyar started his weekly magazine, "Kudi Arasu" to express his views against the Congress party and
        Mahatma Gandhi.</P>

    <B>ABOUT HIS LIFE</B>
    <P>Periyar was born in Erode, Madras Presidency in a rich family. At a young age, he witnessed many incidents of
        racial, caste and gender discrimination. Periyar married when he was 19 and had a daughter who lived for only 5
        months. His first wife, Nagammai, died in 1933. He always protested against young women getting married to much
        older people. Periyar, when he was 72, married for a second time, Maniammai who was 32 at the time in July 1948.
        His second wife, Maniammai, continued Periyar's social work after his death in 1973, but Dravidar Kazhagam was
        still spreading his thoughts and ideas. Periyar fought for the Tamil language, Tamil people, and for their
        rights until his death. Periyar organized anti-Hindi protests in 1938, against introducing Hindi as a compulsory
        language of study in schools. Now in the present days, Periyar's followers are increasing all over the world
        among the Tamil people, due to their interest in Tamil language and history behind them. He revolutionized,
        protested and advised the peoples to spend money for poor peoples and country developement instead of spending
        money in temples, spiritual, luxury function.During that period proverty & famine in Dravida Nadu, laterly some
        oppositions are twisted this message againsts hindus faith & culture. Dravidar Kazhagam is political base and
        root work in Tamilnadu created by E.V. Periyar Ramasamy Nayakar and spread the knowledge about politics and
