    <marquee><b>SPECIAL ABOUT ERODE</b></marquee>
    <B>ABOUT DISTRICT</B>
    <P>Erode District lies on the extreme north of Tamil Nadu. It is bounded mostly by Karnataka State
        and also River Palar covers pretty long distance. To the East lies Namakkal and Karur Districts. Dindigal
        District
        is its immediate neighbour to the South and on the West, it has Coimbatore and Nilgiri Districts, as its
        boundaries.
        Thus Erode District is essentially a land-locked area having no sea-cost of its own. Erode District situated at
        between 10 36” and 11 58” North Latitude and between 76 49” and 77 58” East Longitude.

        The region comprised in the district can be portrayed as a long undulating plain gently sloping towards the
        river
        Cauvery in the south-east. The two major tributaries of river Cauvery viz. Bhavani and Noyyal drain the long
        stretch
        of mountains in the north. A part of the eastern boundary of the district is formed by river Cauvery, entering
        the
        district from Salem and flowing in a southern direction</P>

    <b>CLIMATE</b>
    <p>Erode has a semi-arid climate with hot to sweltering temperatures throughout the year and relatively low
        rainfall. Temperatures range from 80 °F (27 °C) to 96 °F (36 °C) with an average rainfall of 543 millimetres or
        21.4 inches. Like the rest of Tamil Nadu, March to June are the hottest and December to January the mildest
        months of the year. Because the Southwest monsoon (June to August) brings scanty rainfall, the bulk of Erode's
        rainfall is received during the Northeast monsoon in October and November. The city covers an area of 8.44 km2
        (8,440,000 m2).[8]</p>
    <B>ECONOMY</B>
    <P>The economy of Erode is dependent majorly on agriculture and textiles. It a textile hub specializing in hand-loom
        and knitwear.[17][18] Erode is among the largest producers of turmeric.[19][20] Erode Turmeric is recognized as
        Geographical Indications by the Government of India.[21] Erode is one of the largest manufacturers of food
        products in the state with several food product manufacturers and poultries having established their base in and
        around the city.[22] It also has one of the largest markets for coconut and coconut oil in South India.[23]
        Other major industries include leather processing, paper manufacturing and sugarcane processing. There are
        several small and medium-scale industries like dal mills, cotton mills, vanaspathi manufacturers, wax, screen
        printing, and printing presses are located in the city.

        GDP of Erode district grew at 15.5% in 2008 ahead of the state's GDP growth by 4%.[24] According to Indian
        Census of 2001, urban workforce participation rate for Erode is 35% with growth in secondary and tertiary
        sectors and a corresponding decrease in the primary sector. Major employment is provided by textile industry,
        turmeric industry and oil and rice mills with 69% of its workforce employed in tertiary sector. Nethaji Market
        is a wholesale, and retail central market for vegetables and fruits with plans to establish a new wholesale
        market in the outskirts of the city.[25][26]</P>
    <b>RIVERS</b>
    <P>Bhavani, Cauvery and Noyyal are the main rivers of the district. Other significant river is Palar in the North.
        Palar constitutes the boundary between Erode district and Karnataka State in the North. The Bhavanisagar main
        canal along with the above mentioned rivers provide proper drainage and facilities for assured irrigation in the
        district. Bhavani rises in the silent valley in Palghat ranges in the neighbouring State of Kerala after
        receiving Siruvani, a perennial stream of Coimbatore District and gets reinforced by the Kundah river before
        entering Erode District in Gobichettipalayam.

        Bhavani is more or less a perennial river fed mostly by the South-West monsoon. North-East monsoon also
        supplements its water resources. This river runs for over hundred miles through Erode District traversing
        through Bhavani and Gobichettipalayam taluks. It feeds the Bhavanisagar reservoir which takes an easterly course
        flowing through Gobichettipalayam, Sathyamangalam and Bhavani taluks before it ultimately joins river Cauvery on
        the Salem borders.

        Cauvery rising in the Coorg, is joined by many small tributaries. It turns through Karnataka and at Hogenakal
        fall takes a sharp turn, east to south. Before reaching this point, its main tributary, viz., river Kabini joins
        it. From here it takes a south-easterly direction forming the boundary between Bhavani taluk of Erode District
        and Tiruchengode taluk of the neighbouring Namakkal District. After river Bhavani flows into it, the
        south-easterly course is continued forming the boundary between Erode taluk of Erode District and Tiruchengode
        taluk of Namakkal taluk.

        Noyyal river is noted for its capricious nature. This is fed mostly by the South-West monsoon but the North-East
        monsoon brings freshes and this very often results in floods. Inspite of its unpredictable character, the river
        helps to irrigate considerable areasin Palladam taluk of Coimbatore Distrtict and Dharapuram taluk of Tiruppur
        District.</P>
    <B>FPRESTS</B>
    <P>With more than 228,750 hectares of land under dense forest, Erode is one of the few fortunate districts in the
        State which can boost of extensive forest area. 27.7% of the total district area is under forests. These forests
        are rich in commercially significant items such as teak, sandalwood, rosewood, vogai, pillaimaruthu etc.
        Sandalwood is abundant in moyar valley and in strips facting Dodda Combai in Talamalai ranges. Tamarind trees
        are plenty in Bhavani ranges. In high land forest of elevation 2,000 feet to 5,000 feet, diversified flora are
        prevalent. Here we find semi evergreen type, teak type, sandal type, bamboo type and shola type of vegetation.

        Teak is available mostly in ranges of 3,200 feet to 3,600 feet. Important places where bamboo is available are
        in the outer slopes of north Coimbatore plateau between 1,500 feet to 3,000 feet elevation. Main centres of
        availability are Vadaparai and Hussanur basin in Sathyamangalam ranges. Dodda Combai in Bhavani ranges is also
        significant for the availability of bamboo.

        The Southern Forest Rangers’ College at Coimbatore has given a fillip to the forest conservation in this
        district also.

        The district is rich in fauna. It is varied and all the common species normally found in ranges and plains in
        the south are found to occur in this district. Significant is the presence of wild elephants and tigers
        especially on the hills in the northern or north-eastern parts of the district. Cheetahs are not altogether
        absent. They are sparsely distributed. Panthers are found in the scrub jungles and rocky hills of the district.
        Spotted deer, barking deers, jungle sheep etc. are normally present in the northern ranges. The Barugur cattle
        found in Bhavani ranges are though small in size, well built and sturdy.</P>
    <B>AGRICULTURE</B>
    <P>Though noted for trade and industry, the district is by no means backward in the filed of agriculture. Close
        association and link with Coimbatore district which has the advantage of two premier agricultural Institutions
        viz., the Agricultural College and the Research Institute have helped the ryots to keep abrest of developments
        in agricultural methods and practices and also improved strains of seeds. The publicity and developmental
        activities launched by the agricultural institutions in Coimbatore penetrated far and wide in Erode District.
        Added to this was the propaganda and demonstration organised by the Agricultural Department. Availability of
        irrigation facilities coupled with the awareness of improved methods of farming helped the agriculturists to
        forge ahead. Though the soil is not the best, utilisation of improved methods of cultivation and improved
        strains of seeds together have helped the agriculturists in the district to maximise their output. Paddy
        accounts for 86,939 hectares. Next to Paddy is Cholam which is raise in more than 11240 hectares.

        Pulses are not much in cultivation in the district. Only 31498 hectares are used for raising pulses. Among
        condiments and spices, turmeric and chillies are significant. Cultivation of turmeric extends over 14533
        hectares .

        Among the non-food crops, oil seeds constitute the major item. 55.23 % of the total area under non food crops is
        accounted for by oil seeds. A total of 95018 hectares is under oil-seeds cultivation and of these ground-nuts
        account for 55696 hectares while gingely accounts for 24084 hectares. Ground-nut is the most popular oil-seed
        raised here.

        Among other non-food crops raised here, the most important items are cotton, sugarcane and tobacco, sugarcane is
        raised in 30903 hectares. Cotton is grown in few hectares while tobacco is raised in 4923 hectares in the
        district. In respect of all commercial crops also improved varieties have been adopted by the farmers and this
        has helped them to maintain high yields.</P>
    <B>EdDUCATION & HEALTH</B>
    <P>In the field of education also, Erode District has recorded remarkable achievement. There are a number of well
        established schools and colleges preparing students for the usual degree and post-graduate degree courses in
        various branches of science and humanities. Apart from these institutions, there are a number of Polytechnic and
        other institutions which provide technical education.

        Medical facilities are provided by the District Headquarters Hospital at Erode and taluk hospitals at each taluk
        headquarters. Public health activities are guided and supervised by the District Health Officers Erode and Joint
        Director of Medicals at Erode. There is a Medical College at Perundurai run by the Road Transport Corporation.
        There are 74 Primary Health Centres under the control of District Health Officer at Erode. These institutions
        provide succor to the suffering people. 277 Primary Health Sub-centres under the control of District Health
        Officer at Erode.</P>
    <B>Places of Historical, Religious and Archaeological importance</B>
    <P>There are nearly 487 temples in Erode District. They are situated in four taluks, Bhavani, Gobichettipalayam,
        Erode and Dharapuram. Of the 207 places recognised as padal petra sthalam, there are two temples found in Erode
        District viz., Bhavani and Kodumudi.

        Bhavani Sangameswarar temple is located at the junction of two rivers, Bhavani and Cauvery. It is known as South
        Prayag and is having a Pagoda of 120 inch in height. It is believed that Bhavani and Amudha (not visible now)

        It is said to have existed even before the days of the first Kind Mahendravarma of Pallava dynasty.
        Thirugnanasambandar one of the four Tamil saints has sung in praise of this temple. Poet Vasudevan also gives
        the history of the temple in ‘Bhavani Kudal Puranam’ written in Sanskrit.

        Bannari Mariamman Temple is about 15 kms. from Bhavani Sagar town on the road to Mysore. It is a place of
        pilgrimage during the annual festival known as “Kundam” which takes place in the middle of March every year.
